# HackNSlash
Personal project about an Hack and slash type game 

Here's one of my personnal projects covering hack and slash.
I tried to work very hard on the feed back, visual effects and gameplay features.
Spending lots of time tweeking thoses aspects.
It's a style of game that i particulary like and making this little one was fun !

Hope you enjoy it !

Thanks to Nicolas Martin-Belou for sharing with me his work on snow stylised environment.
